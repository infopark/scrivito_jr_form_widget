# scrivito_jr_form_widget

## Description

A Widget for Scrivito to add an formular based on an activity type from Justrelate using API 2.

## Installation

Add this lines to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'scrivito_jr_form_widget'

Add this line to your stylsheet manifest:
    
    *= require scrivito_jr_form_widget

Add this line to your Javascript manifest:

    //= require scrivito_jr_form_widget    

Create a Model with name `CrmFormAttribtues`. It is used by the presenter to make your custom attributes accessible by the form. You can define prefill values here.

```ruby
class CrmFormAttributes
  include ActiveModel::Model

  attr_accessor :custom_attribute_1, :custom_attribute_2, ...

  def custom_attribute_3
    "My Prefill Value"
  end
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    $ rake scrivito:migrate:install
    $ rake scrivito:migrate
    $ rake scrivito:migrate:publish

## Customization

The label of every field gets the class `mandatory` if the field is marked as mandatory in the activity. You can style this with css, for example:

    label.mandatory:after {
      content: "*";
    }

If the creation of a new activity fails at a form submit, the `flash[:alert]` value is set. Just Relate SDK message will used as flash message. It will look like this:

    [
     {
       "attribute" => "gender",
       "code" => "inclusion",
       "message" => "gender is not included in the list: unknown, male, female"
     },
     {
       "attribute" => "language",
       "code" => "inclusion",
       "message" => "language is not included in the list"
     },
     {
       "attribute" => "last_name",
       "code" => "blank",
       "message" => "last_name can't be blank"
     }
    ]

You can use this to create a message for the user.

Using more than one Page with your just relate and activities should be seperated. You can add a hook with your separation strategy. Simply add the method `self.jr_activity_filter` to your obj.rb.

    def self.jr_activity_filter
      Crm::Type.all.select { |a| a.id.starts_with? 'page-' }
    end

This will select activities by its id.
